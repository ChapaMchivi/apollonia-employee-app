# Apollonia Employee App

A modular CRUD web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to manage medical staff and departments for Apollonia Dental Practice.

##  Project Overview

-  **GET All Employees** — Retrieve a list of all medical staff
-  **POST New Employee** — Create employee records with first name, last name, email, and department
-  **GET All Departments** — Retrieve a list of clinic departments
-  **POST New Department** — Create new department entries
-  **PUT Department by ID** — Update department details with validation and duplicate protection

- **10 Employees**:
  - Lisa Harris, Alfred Christensen, John Dudley, Danny Perez, Sarah Alvarez, Constance Smith, Travis Combs, Francisco Willard, Janet Doe, Leslie Roche
